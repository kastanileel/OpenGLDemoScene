## Structure:
  - The demo consists of 3 scenes
  - Scene 1 shows some very basic rendering and shading such as:
    - ambient lighting
    - diffuse lighting
    - cell shading + diffuse lighting
  - Scene 2 can be interpreted as a transition to scene 3
  - Scene 3 shows a shader that looks lika an endlessly rotating hole

Here is a **480p recording** of the demo.
